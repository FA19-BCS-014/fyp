### üí¨ : Project Abstract

**Student Hourly-Based Job Tracker System ([Hourly-Finder](https://hourly-finder.vercel.app/))** is a web application that helps **students** find [hourly-based jobs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hourly_worker) nearby and helps **recruiters** hire employees, **track** their work progress, and pay accordingly. In developed countries, students participate in many types of ordinary jobs on an hourly basis, but there is no scope for such jobs in our country. More than **65** percent population of Bangladesh is of working age, between 15 and 64, says [The DailyStar](https://www.thedailystar.net/lifestyle/perspective/news/demographic-dividend-could-turn-demographic-disaster-1709272). The majority of them are students of many institutions. If their involvement in hourly or part-time work increases, they can bear their expenses, be confident, and contribute to the economy. Moreover, businesses might not need a full-time employee for several jobs, and hiring on an hourly basis can help maximize their profits. We developed a platform that promotes hourly-based jobs. It motivates students to work on hourly jobs and also encourages recruiters to hire employees on an hourly basis. Our application is available for both smartphones and computer devices to ease the process of posting and finding jobs. We used [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) in the frontend and [Django REST Framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/) in the backend to build our application. As a result, we have a flexible platform where job seekers can work whenever they want, and businesses or recruiters can get help whenever they need it. Thus finding, hiring, and tracking hourly-based jobs after it is started is easier for both job-seekers and recruiters. Our application can also be used for project-based and part-time jobs. It made finding jobs more straightforward and reduced hassle for recruiters. Our application can **inspire** students to work beside study and recruiters to post hourly jobs and increase profit.
